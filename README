Instructions:
run "make test" run all tests on the code. Shouldn't pass right now.


Notes to Programmers:
A global structure called "mounted" now exists.
An all-in-one testing regime was added but needs to be completed. You can help with that if you want.
Give Rocky a list of things you want to test for if you feel like it. I will be trying to break your code in every possible way. Be prepared.
TODO: Add valgrind to tests?

Questions:
- ask what is expected from us out of the manual error stuff

- What should the behavior be when trying to mount a disk that fails? Do we keep the current one or unmount it?
