Instructions:
run "make test" run all tests on the code. Currently it only points to the unit tests function, but if given the
    proper input, Rocky can code up something that diffs the output of the other tests to the correct input if
    that's something we want.


Notes to Programmers:
Rocky is working on tfs_mount and tfs_unmount
Rocky will implement a global structure that will keep track of info on the mounted disk.
unitTests.c was made, allowing for individual unit testing of each function for specific error codes or specific cases.
Rocky will update unitTests if you give him a list of things that need to be tested for. I will also try to break your code in every possible way at some point.

Questions:
- ask what is expected from us out of the manual error stuff

- Are we only mounting one system at a time?
